# Drought - HTML & CSS Barebones

Drought is what I use to start new projects. It provides a CSS reset, a basic two column website layout and lots of great standards from [H5BP](http://html5boilerplate.com). It also includes a typical HTML structure that I tend to use. This has grown over the past several years from just a few snippets that I used often to what you see. I have adapted so many great things from other boilerplates and add stuff that works for me. Feel free to take what you want from it or get inspired to create your own.
