# Drought - HTML & CSS Barebones

Drought is what I use to start new projects. It starts with a basic two column layout, normalize.css and lots of great standards from [H5BP](http://html5boilerplate.com). It also includes a typical HTML structure and basic CSS that I tend to use and as of `v3.0` it includes LESS and now SASS, thanks to [John Hoover](http://defvayne23.com). This has grown over the past several years from just a few snippets that I used often to what you see. I have adapted so many great things from other boilerplates and added what works for me. Feel free to take what you want from it or get inspired to create your own.

Get started by doing a quick git clone, `git clone git@github.com:jamesfleeting/Drought.git`, or [downloading the latest release](https://github.com/jamesfleeting/Drought/archive/master.zip). I'm constantly tweaking this project so if you are interested in that sort of stuff check out the `wip` branch, if there is one right now.

## Problem?

If you happen to use Drought and have any problems feel free to file an issue above. Try and describe the problem as "your code is brokenz" isn't as helpful as one might think.
