{"name":"Drought","body":"# Drought - HTML & CSS Barebones\r\n\r\nDrought is what I use to start new projects. It provides a CSS reset, a basic two column website layout and lots of great standards from [H5BP](http://html5boilerplate.com). It also includes a typical HTML structure that I tend to use. This has grown over the past several years from just a few snippets that I used often to what you see. I have adapted so many great things from other boilerplates and add stuff that works for me. Feel free to take what you want from it or get inspired to create your own.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n### Major components:\r\n\r\n* jQuery: MIT/GPL license\r\n* Modernizr: MIT/BSD license\r\n\r\n### Everything else:\r\n\r\nThe Unlicense (aka: public domain)","tagline":"Just some barebones HTML/CSS to start each project. No single boilerplate/framework is perfect for all but here is what I've found works for me right now.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
